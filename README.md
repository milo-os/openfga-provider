# Milo OpenFGA Auth Provider

Authorization infrastructure for Milo's business operating system backed by
OpenFGA - enabling fine-grained, relationship-based access control across
business entities like customers, products, agreements, and organizational
resources.

## Overview

This project provides the authorization backbone for the [Milo business
operating system](https://github.com/milo-os/milo), which uses Kubernetes
APIServer patterns to manage business entities for product-led B2B companies.
The auth provider bridges Milo's business APIs with OpenFGA's relationship-based
authorization engine to answer complex business questions like:

- *"Can this sales rep view pricing for customers in this project?"*
- *"Can this account manager modify agreements for this organization?"*
- *"Which product features can this customer access based on their
  entitlements?"*

### Key Capabilities

1. **Resource Authorization** - Protects Milo's resources using
   relationship-based policies
2. **Organizational Hierarchies** - Supports complex business structures with
   permission inheritance across organizations and projects
3. **Dynamic Permission Models** - Automatically builds authorization models as
   new resource types are registered in Milo
4. **Real-time Access Control** - Provides webhook-based authorization that
   integrates seamlessly with Milo's Kubernetes-based APIs

## How It Works

1. **Resource Registration**: `ProtectedResource` CRDs define what resources
   should be protected and what permissions are available (view, edit, delete,
   manage)
2. **Authorization Model Sync**: The system automatically builds OpenFGA type
   definitions based on registered resources
3. **Role Management**: `Role` CRDs define roles (Sales Rep, Account Manager)
   with collections of permissions
4. **Access Binding**: `PolicyBinding` CRDs create relationships between
   subjects, roles, and target resources
5. **Runtime Authorization**: Webhook servers evaluate access requests by
   querying OpenFGA relationship graphs
6. **Inheritance Support**: Resources inherit permissions through organizational
   hierarchies (Organization → Project → Customer)
